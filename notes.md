## Planning the application ##

There are many well-known differences between US English and UK English spelling. 
However, there is only one English Wikipedia, which does not define a language variant.
We want to see how articles of the English Wikipedia are written; which variant is preferred throughout?

Wikipedia articles are created and updated by a group of people who might use different spelling conventions.
Do Wikipedia articles then have mixed use of US and UK spelling?

The program would have a simple input of a word (in either spelling). 

The output would include:
* percentages of the word in UK and US spelling
* a list of articles that have mixed spelling of the word

NOTE:
Exclude from the data the Wikipedia article on US and UK English spelling differences! :)
